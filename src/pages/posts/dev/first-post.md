I was using Gatsby for some time when I heard about Github Actions. Then the light bulb went on in my head that I can use Github Actions to publish my posts on the blog without effort. Without CMS and only using git and command line. When I joined this community, my objectives have changed slightly. From this time I wanted to publish my posts on blog and dev.to and share a few thoughts about it with you.

The first step to do that was choosing Gatsby's starter or creating a template from scratch. And then put content in it. I chose a second option, creating my template from scratch. Mainly because I wanted to get to know Gatsby framework and I like DIYing things.

After that was time to use appropriate action from Github's marketplace.
